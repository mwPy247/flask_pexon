To build the Docker image from the Dockerfile, go to the project directory and run
docker build .

To start the container run:
docker run -d -t- p 8080:8080 <container_id|container_name>

To run the program from inside the container run to get into the container:
docker exec -it <container_id|container_name> ../bin/sh

From there you can first run all unittests:
python -m unittest

You can then launch the app:
python app.py

The app can then be accessed from http://localhost:8080/
